# Week5 workshop

This week your job is to be the first to solve challenges posted on the GitHub Issues of this repository.

First, you'll be given instructions to assemble yourselves into teams. 

Then, you have to give your team a name.

Once all the teams have names, I'll put the first challenge into GitHub Issues, and start the timer.

First correct solution posted wins the prize!

# GOOD LUCK!
